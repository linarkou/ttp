## Travelling Thief Problem
This is my Master's thesis in computer science at ITMO University for solving [Travelling Thief Problem](https://cs.adelaide.edu.au/~zbyszek/Papers/TTP.pdf).

I've suggested some local search operators that improved [CS2SA algorithm](https://github.com/yafrani/ttplab).

For more information see [thesis.pdf](./docs/thesis.pdf) or [presentation.pdf](./docs/presentation.pdf).

Executable's for my & other algorithms for solving TTP can be found in [/executable](./executable).
